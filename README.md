# AirBnB Clone
The AirBnb clone is a simple copy of the AirBnB website. It is a complete web application composed by:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## 1st - The console
The console is a command line interpreter that will take in commands used to manage various data and objects
on the storeage engine for the backend part of the website. It should be able to ;

- manage and manipulate data models and object (create, update, destroy, etc) objects
- retrieve, store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
- operate on objects  (count, compute stats, etc...)
- Update attributes of an object
